# Uphill--Diffusion
Used Matlab code to stimulate the Uphill and Downhill diffusion using chemical potential
downhill.m ---> 1D plot downhill diffusion of concetration starting from digital type concentration
Gvs_X.m  ----> Free energy vs Concentration plot at diiferent temperatures and determing the where the spinoidal decomposition start
exp 5_1.m ---->2d surface plot of Uphill diffusion  concentration using chemival potential  term
exp 5_2.m ---->2d surface plot of uphill diffusion of initial random noise 
exp 5_3.m ---->2d surface plot of downhill diffusion if initial sinsoidal noise
exp 5_4.m ---->surface plot to check whether the maxima and minima of concentration in demixing lies in range of G vs X plot
